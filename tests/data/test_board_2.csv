Pour ce premier semestre de l'année 2023, voilà un aperçu de nos actions. En étroite collaboration avec la Croix-Rouge Nigérienne (CRN), le CICR s'est employé à répondre aux besoins dans un contexte humanitaire caractérisé où les besoins des communautés affectées ne font que s'accroitre en raison de plusieurs chocs. Dans cette situation, les personnes déplacées sont les plus vulnérables. Le CICR leur vient en aide d'urgence en leur distribuant des kits de bien essentiel de ménage et en soutenant leurs productions agricoles. Ainsi : 9 562 personnes déplacés appuyés en kits EHI (bien essentiels de ménages), 43 043 personnes déplacés ou refugiées soutenus à la production agricole. Dans le cadre de l'amélioration de la santé, le CICR soutient les centres de santé intégrés (CSI) et les hôpitaux dans les zones affectées par les conflits armés pour faciliter l'accès aux soins de santé primaires, la prise en charge des blessés par arme et des urgences vitales. Dans ce sens, 130 340 Personnes ont bénéficié de soins de santé aux CSI soutenus par le CICR; 1 358 Personnes ont reçu des soins d’urgences vitales. L'action du CICR ne se limite pas aux réponses d'urgence. Il assiste aussi les populations affectées afin de garantir leur sécurité économique. Cette assistance vise à permettre aux populations affectées de subvenir aux besoins de leurs familles, et se traduit de plusieurs manières à savoir : garantir la bonne santé du bétail car l'élevage et l'agriculture sont les principales sources de revenu des populations, mettre en uvre des activités génératrices de revenus; prioriser le travail rémunéré, (cash for work) etc. 3 96 244 têtes d’animaux appartenant à 94 612 ménages ont été vaccinées, 9 366 personnes appuyés dans le cadre de cash for work à Diffa et Tahoua pour la réalisation de bandes pares-feux et de désensablement de parcs de vaccination.","Niger : notre action de janvier à juin 2023","2023-10-25T11:39:20.822854Z"

That is why nutrition is key for health in general and especially for those who suffer from this disease.  In the same sense, it is advisable to avoid certain foods that are detrimental to osteoarthritis and thus help to minimize its effects on the body. It is important to keep in mind that if the necessary measures are taken in time, symptoms such as inflammation of the joints, which is presented through intense pain, will be in the end not serious consequences that can be suffered.  For this reason, many experts recommend maintaining a proper diet in accordance with this disease, in order to deal with osteoarthritis in a more effective way than the same drugs prescribed for its treatment. This does not mean that they should not be used either, as this is subject to the recommendation of the medical expert.  Conditions caused by osteoarthritisPrecisely speaking of food, if it is carried out through bad habits, it can lead to overweight, one of the major consequences in those suffering from osteoarthritis. For this reason, it is important to be very careful with the diet, especially if there are cases of this disease in the family history, since it is a generic disease.  It is also key to always maintain a good physical activity and in that sense, keep well hydrated and in a proper way, as this will help prevent the development of this disease.  Foods to avoid for osteoarthritisIt should be clarified that osteoarthritis cannot be cured through food, but it is possible to counteract its negative effects on the body, making it more bearable or generating fewer complications. It may sound poetic, but small changes in the diet will generate great changes in favor of health with respect to the disease, such as weight loss, which benefits health in general.  So, these are the food groups to avoid if you suffer from osteoarthritis:  High in purine and uric acid.Purine is a compound that is abundant in seafood, red meat and those rich in fat, which is ultimately transformed into uric acid. These foods should be completely eliminated from the diet, as they can generate gout, which occurs due to the accumulation of uric acid in the blood, which forms crystals that are located in the joints and cause pain.  Sunflower and soybean oilThese oils are harmful for osteoarthritis due to their high level of omega-6 fatty acids, which produce an increase in inflammation.  SugarIt is widely known that sugar generates obesity, so for a person suffering from arthritis, this food can be one of its worst enemies, especially if you are already overweight.  Similarly, there are studies that claim that sugar can cause an increase in swelling, so it is recommended that it be completely eliminated from the diet.  Alkaline diet to fight arthritisWear and tear and inflammation in the bones, muscles and tendons can be caused by a sedentary lifestyle, mechanical and repetitive work, poor diet and even simple genetics.  For this reason, many specialists recommend an alkalizing diet to treat joint pain, in addition to favoring the elimination of heavy metals and toxins, as well as neutralizing acidity, symptoms that cause joint degeneration.  This diet is based mainly on the consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and plenty of water.
